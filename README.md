## Introduction
 
The medical field has been facing the challenges of identifying pneumonia in patients with accuracy . It is required to build a diagnostic tool  using convolution neural networks with satisfactory accuracy rate for pneumonia diagnosis. This project focuses on demonstrating the diagnosis of pneumonia using chest x_ray images.

## Business Problem
The current outbreak of coronavirus has been identified as a highly contagious and deadly virus . Due to increases in death and limited medical resources, doctors and medical professionals are doing their best to control the spread of the virus.  The virus is reported to cause severe forms of pneumonia in humans .
 
Hence it is necessary to identify pneumonia quickly to save  them from any life threatening complications. However even the trained radiologist finds it challenging to identify the pneumonia in x_ray. Thus there is a need to improve the diagnosis accuracy.  Hence one of the leading hospitals wants to build an efficient model to detect whether the x_ray of a person has pneumonia or not, which could aid the radiologists in their decision making process. Thus this project focuses on building a deep neural network to classify the images as either pneumonia or normal based on the x_ray of the person.

 
 ## The Data
 
The dataset used in this project is the Chest X_Ray Images(Pneumonia) from kaggle. It consists of training data,testing data and validation data. Training data consist of 5216 images, test data consist of 624 images and validation data consist of 16 images.


## Approach

In this project we are following OSEMN data science workflow. It contains:

* Obtain (Generate data)
* Scrub (extracting columns,handling missing values)
* Explore (understanding data and create visualization)
* Model (building regression model)
* Interpret (communicating results)
