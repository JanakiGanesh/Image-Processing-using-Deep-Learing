## Introduction
 
This project focuses on building a deep neural network for the image classification. The images used in this project are the chest x_ray images which are used to identify whether it has pneumonia or not.

## Business Problem
The current outbreak of coronavirus has been identified as a highly contagious and deadly virus . Due to increases in death and limited medical resources, doctors and medical professionals are doing their best to control the spread of the virus.  The virus is reported to cause severe forms of pneumonia in humans . 

Hence it is necessary to identify pneumonia quickly to save  them from any life threatening complications. However even the trained radiologist finds it challenging to identify the pneumonia in x_ray. Thus there is a need to improve the diagnosis accuracy.  Hence one of the leading hospital wants to build a efficient model to detect whether the x_ray of a person has pneumonia or not, which could aid the radiologists in their decision making process. Thus this project focuses on building a deep neural network to classify the images as either pneumonia or normal based on the x_ray of the person.
 
 ## The Data
 
The dataset used in this project is the Chest X_Ray Images(Pneumonia) from kaggle. It consists of training data,testing data and validation data. Training data consist of 5216 images, test data consist of 624 images and validation data consist of 16 images.
